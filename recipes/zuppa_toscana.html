    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 pound bulk mild Italian sausage</li>
      <li>1 ¼ teaspoons crushed red pepper flakes</li>
      <li>4 slices bacon, cut into 1/2 inch pieces</li>
      <li>1 large onion, diced</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon minced garlic</li>
      <li>5 (13.75 ounce) cans chicken broth</li>
      <li>6 potatoes, thinly sliced</li>
      <li>1 cup heavy cream</li>
      <li>¼ bunch fresh spinach, tough stems removed</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Cook the Italian sausage and red pepper flakes in a Dutch oven over
        medium-high heat until crumbly, browned, and no longer pink, 10 to 15
        minutes. Drain and set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cook the bacon in the same Dutch oven over medium heat until crisp,
        about 10 minutes. Drain, leaving a few tablespoons of drippings with the
        bacon in the bottom of the Dutch oven. Stir in the onions and garlic;
        cook until onions are soft and translucent, about 5 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour the chicken broth into the Dutch oven with the bacon and onion
        mixture; bring to a boil over high heat. Add the potatoes, and boil
        until fork tender, about 20 minutes. Reduce the heat to medium and stir
        in the heavy cream and the cooked sausage; heat through. Mix the spinach
        into the soup just before serving.
